# Write code that displays your favorite color:

# This is an example of code with multiple

print("Hello, Shamserul_Maheen!")

# Write code that displays your favorite color:
favorite_color = "Sapphire blue"  # Assign your favorite color to a variable

# Print your favorite color
print(f"My favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

# Write code that answers the question "How are you feeling today?":

# Ask the user how they are feeling
feeling = input("How are you feeling today? ")

# Respond with the user's input
print(f"I'm glad to hear you're feeling {feeling}!")

# Print your favorite color
print("My favorite color is", favorite_color + ".")

# Write code that answers the question "How are you feeling today?":

# Ask the user how they are feeling
feeling = input("How are you feeling today? ")

# Respond with the user's input
print("I'm glad to hear you're feeling", feeling + "!")

Certainly! Let's analyze the provided code snippet and suggest improvements:

### Code Smells and Antipatterns
1. **Redundant Code**: There are duplicate print statements and comments that could be consolidated.
2. **Inconsistent String Formatting**: Mixing `+` for string concatenation and f-strings.
3. **Excessive Comments**: Some comments are redundant and can be removed to improve readability.

### Recommendations
1. **Remove Duplicate Code**: Consolidate the repeated print statements and comments.
2. **Consistent String Formatting**: Use f-strings consistently for better readability and performance.
3. **Clean Up Comments**: Remove redundant comments and keep only those that add value.

### Improved Code Example
Here is the improved version of the code:

```python
# Greet the user
print("Hello, Shamserul_Maheen!")
print("How is your day going?")

# Assign your favorite color to a variable and print it
favorite_color = "Sapphire blue"
print(f"My favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

# Ask the user how they are feeling today and respond
feeling = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print(f"I'm glad to hear you're feeling {feeling}!")
```

### Explanation
1. **Consolidation**: Removed the duplicate comments and print statements.
2. **Consistent String Formatting**: Used f-strings for all print statements to maintain consistency.
3. **Simplified Comments**: Kept comments concise and relevant to enhance readability.

These changes make the code cleaner, more readable, and maintainable.
